## My Week 6 @ Polygon Fellowship: NFTs and Metaverse

EDIT: I actually wrote this during the Fellowship's Week 6 and just realised that I never posted it.

Hey all! I am glad you are up for another week of learning and levelling up, this week was all about NFTs and Metaverse. If you have no idea what's this blog post is all about, please check my [Week 1 post](https://rakshit087.hashnode.dev/my-week-1-polygon-fellowship). 
Just to give a brief overview I post about my experience at Polygon Fellowship and try to cover everything I have learnt here through relevant articles and videos. 
Lot to unpack, let's begin.

# Week 6: Study Material ðŸ“š

## What are NFTs
NFTs are unique tokens that can represent ownership of anything like art, collectables, real world assets etc. Since they are unique in nature they only have one owner.
A really good article about NFTs can be read [here](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/).

## Writing & Deploying your NFT 
The study material had a really short tutorial on how to work on our own NFT collection. Again I cannot share the entire tutorial since it would be beyond the scope of this post but you can read about how to make your own NFTs [here](https://ethereum.org/sl/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/).

## What is Metaverse 
The metaverse is a concept of a online universe that combines multiple different virtual spaces. You can think of it as a future iteration of the internet. The metaverse will allow users to work, meet, game, and socialize together in these spaces.
Some examples of Metaverse:
* Decentraland
* Axie Infinity

## Play to Earn Games

Yus, I also learnt about play to earn games. These are games that pay you for playing the game. How does it work? The rewards basically come from stacking, NFTs, farming a game's currency. Every game has a different economy model.

EDIT: After the fellowship I minted Sunflower Land, my Land is Land #150413.

# Week 6: Assignments

This week's assignment was pretty easy, we were supposed to mint our own NFT collection, but these NFTs must be dynamic where image of NFT can be changed by the owner. 

That's it folks :) That was week 6. 
See you next week.
